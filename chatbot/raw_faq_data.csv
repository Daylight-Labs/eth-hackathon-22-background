Is tBTC the same as T?,"No, T is the work token of the Threshold Network and tBtc is a fully Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin. It facilitates Bitcoin holders to act on the Ethereum blockchain and access the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem."
What is tBtc v2?,"tBTC v2 is the ERC-20 token created from our upcoming bridging protocol (the tBTC v2 Bridge) on the Threshold Network — the network formed from the merger of Keep Network and NuCypher. This protocol will have 100x the scalability of the original tBTC v1 protocol. In addition to its intrinsic trustlessness and transparency, tBTC v2 will compete with WBTC when it comes to liquidity, convenience, and speed. This is the first step of a 6 month process for safely phasing out the tBTC v1 token and bridging and migrating to tBTC v2. Through the tBTC Token Upgrade Portal 2 the upgrade process is really simple: it upgrades tBTC v1 to tBTC v2 and downgrades tBTC v2 to tBTC v1. This means that every minted tBTC v2 token is backed by tBTC v1 tokens held in the vending machine contract. These v1 tokens are backed by BTC held by the tBTC v1 Bridge created for the deposit.When the tBTC v2 Bridge is launched on the Threshold Network after Keep Network’s merge with NuCypher, anyone will be able to mint tBTC v2 simply by depositing BTC. This will be similar to minting tBTC v1, but simpler, cheaper, and with no foreseeable upper limit on minting. Our v2 tBTC bridge will be as convenient and easy to use as WBTC, but trustless and transparent — unlike anything else on the market. Once the tBTC v2 bridge is released users will be able to mint tBTC v2 directly with BTC. This means tBTC v2 will always be backed by either BTC or tBTC v1 that is in turn backed by BTC."
What are the tokenomics of Threshold Network?,"Total Supply = 10 Billion, 4.5 billion for nucypher token holders, 4.5 billion to keep holders, 1 billion to Dao"
Who can I speak to about an exchange listing?,"T will be an ERC20 token, so exchanges are able to list freely without involvement from the team."
Who may I speak to about partnerships?,For integrations with our networks please reach out to the Threshold Integrations Guild on discord.
How can I be part of the community?,"Join The Threshold Network’s discord server and become an active community member by claiming a role in one of the guilds by going to the ""claim-a-role"" channel and reacting to the specific guild you'd like to join with it's given emoji."
What does the Marketing Guild Do?,"The Marketing guild seeks constructive and creative methods to bring awareness to what The Threshold Network is and what products/services it offers. It is the Marketing Guild's mission to bring clarity to questions regarding what Threshold Network is, how and why it stands out from other Protocols in the DeFi ecosystem to current and potential future community members.

What does the Integrations Guild Do?,Integrations Guild works to build relationship  tocols allowing for a larger market to access and use tBTC in the DeFi ecosystem.
How do you wrap NU/Keep into T?,
How do you unwrap T back to NU/Keep?,
"gm; looking to withdrawal KEEP-only legacy and deposit for CovKEEP. Since I made the initial deposit, I've switched over to hardware wallet. Wondering if there's a custom token I would have received for the deposit (contract address to add to metamask) that I can transfer from my hot wallet to my hardware wallet before making the transactions","You'd need to withdraw your KEEP from the KEEP only pool, and then it's probably easiest to first move it to your hww and from there add it to the coverage pools"
What is the benefit of the network merger between NU and Keep?,https://twitter.com/NuCypher/status/1478478558280527885?s=20&t=sUDMynarfjnLv8blAxR5Yw
Will NU/Keep dump after the merger?,"Not financial advice. The way the upgrade works is that if T has value in the future NU and KEEP will as well since they can always be wrapped to T. So a situation where T pumps and NU/KEEP dump doesn't really make sense - it'd be free money to buy NU/KEEP and wrap it to T. We don't know the future of course, but I doubt the community, token holders, and stakers would have approved the merge if they thought it would be value destructive. Obviously, nothing is guaranteed but presumably in voting to approve the merge, they believed it would be value accretive"

"I hold NuCypher in my coinlist, will they be converted into T tokens?","Update from coinlist: “You are receiving this email because you are currently participating in Nucypher staking on CoinList. As a reminder, Nucypher is planning to upgrade into the Threshold Network in February, which previously impacted staking rewards and transactions. Your Nucypher stake is now unlocked & distributed, and all previously staked NU can be freely moved: Your previously staked NU is now distributed to your CoinList wallet Your NU is freely tradable and transferable Moving forward, you will no longer be able to stake your NU with CoinList Over the coming weeks, we will provide updates on Threshold (T) staking and how you can participate on CoinList, as well as how to convert your NU tokens to Threshold tokens"
Is it possible to buy T on Avalanche or some other chain to avoid ETH gas? Or any plan for that?,no plans for that now
Will Keep/NuCypher nodes become themselves to Threshold nodes in the future?,"Yes, existing NU and KEEP nodes can become Threhsold nodes."
What will happen to governance for NU/KEEP?,T becomes the governance and staking token for the network in place of NU and KEEP.
What will happen to staking for NU/KEEP?,Stakers (whether T or legacy NU/KEEP that properly migrate) receive rewards in T
What are some projects that are using Threshold?,"Creaton, Masterfile, Nulink and others that are still in stealth!"

"I can't deposit 5 or 10 BTC through dapp... it says not enough operators in the pool, anyone has any clue on this issue?","the current version of tbtc running on Keep has limited minting capacity. the tbtcv2 bridge that will be launching on Threshold fixes this, but it's not available yet"
"what mechanisms or activities are envisioned that would reduce the supply of T, to theoretically keep inflation of 10% less of an issue to non-staking T holders?","Under the current proposal inflation would only be 10% if all the supply gets staked (in which case no one gets diluted anyway). Realistically, it would be some lower amount. Ofc, the DAO can decide to make the amount higher or lower, but it’s always up to token holders so non-staking T holders always have influence on the amount. Afaik the most popular fee model being contemplated for Threshold applications is a buyback and burn/make/distribute to treasury model"
will there also be support added for T on ledger?,T is an erc20 token so you can store it on ledger already
will Keep and Nu be delisted  and gone etc and only T or is T something that can enhance the token Nu itself?,Keep and NuCypher team members now work on the Threshold Network.  The token to participate in staking and governance will be T.  NU and Keep held on exchanges will be subject to their terms for the upgrade.  We can not speculate on when CEXs will list or delist specific assets but the ultimate goal is for everyone who owns NU or KEEP to eventually choose to wrap so that they are able to participate in the Threshold Network.

What will happen to the NU/Keep on exchanges?,"While each may have announced separate dates and timelines, the TL;DR is that those exchanges plan to: - Suspend and subsequently close NU and KEEP positions - Suspend deposits and withdrawals of NU and KEEP - Delist NU and KEEP trading pairs - Upgrade customer NU / KEEP holdings to T based on the relevant ratio - List and open trading pairs for T - Open deposits and withdrawals for T If you are holding NU or KEEP in these exchanges, your account balance may not be accurately reflected until the upgrade process is completed. As always, exchanges are independent, so best to chat directly with them if you have any questions/concerns about their specific upgrade process."
What is the vision for tbtc v2?,"tBTC v2 will be the first non-custodial solution to bridge BTC to Ethereum at scale. Our mission is to extend Bitcoin’s properties onto every major network. We plan to launch our v2 Ethereum bridge in Q2, and deploy onto other chains in Q4. check out this great blog post for more detail including a rough list of milestones for the year. https://blog.threshold.network/tbtc-v2-vision-for-2022/ "
How do I get T token ?,By wrapping your NU or KEEP token
How much T will I receive ?,The rate (aka Token Factors) at which T is received for wrapping NU/KEEP depends on the total allocated supply of both tokens. This rate is determined once inflation of the existing tokens has been suspense. This allows us to maintain an equal split between each network’s stakeholders.
What happens if my KEEP or NU are locked in staking ?,An adapter will allow to operate nodes on the upgraded network and receive T token rewards with current KEEP/NU stakes. Once these tokens are unlocked & liquid they could be wrapped to upgrade them to T token.
Can I get my Nu or Keep token back later ?,"If you want you can unwrap your T token, but ONLY to the original wrapping address, and to the maximum of the original amounts that were wrapped (unwrapping is not fungible)."
Can I buy T token to unwrap them later to NU or KEEP ?,"You can buy T token on the market to hold, trade or stake, but you CAN'T use bought T token to unwrap to KEEP or NU. This is only allowed to original amounts of KEEP/NU and address used to wrap them."
Can I unwrap earned T token ?,No.
Is there a deadline to join Keanu Network ?,"No, The upgrade wrapper contract will be perpetually accessible and enable NU/KEEP token holders to join the Keanu network whenever they want without needing to buy or sell any assets."
"I rather would stay on NuCypher or Keep Network, can I ?","Network participants are welcome to remain on NuCypher or Keep, but if they would like to upgrade to Keanu, they are always welcome to do so with no penalty or obligations."
Who can recieve the T token?,Anyone who owns KEEP or NU token can wrap their tokens in order to get T tokens.
Will there be cost involved in wrapping and unwrapping ?,Ethereum network fees will need to be paid during wrapping and unwrapping.
How do I buy T on Curve?,https://curve.fi/teth
What is the min for staking T?,40K T
What is the minimum amount of T for staking?,"40,000T"
Is Threshold Network its own blockchain or is it on Ethereum?,"It's a network, but not a blockchain. Threshold's T token is an erc20 token on Ethereum"
What is the APY of T? How do I earn T?,There are currently multiple options to earn with T. Staking is live (rewards don't kick in until later this month) and will yield around 333 T per month per 40k T staked. https://dashboard.threshold.network/overview/network The community incentivizes rewards for LPs into the t / eth pool on curve. APY info available here - https://curve.fi/teth
"When running a node, is there any kind of slashing penalty that happens if there is downtime?","in the interim period when it's just a PRE node, no. but ultimately, yes, there will be slashing once all the applications (i.e. tbtc, etc.) are launched"
I have a question. Has it been decided yet if 40000t to run a node can run all services. Reason I ask is let’s say I set up a pre node and I put 100000 T to run it. If  I want to run other services would I have to stake another 40000 and run another node.,you can reuse your stake for multiple services
Is there a guide to set up T staking,https://interim-pre-application-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
How do I withdraw ETH from worklock?,The StakingEscrow contract still contains the code needed for anyone who still has ETH locked in Worklock.  It should be withdrawable
"So the exchange rate of 1 NU for 3.26 T and 1 KEEP for 4.78 T. Is this exchange rate the same forever? No matter the price of NU , KEEP and T?",It's fixed indeed. They are contract parameters of the vending machine
"Hey all - new here want to confirm some things. Were emissions of Nu/Keep stopped, or are those tokens still emitted?",Stopped
"Could you give me a hint, where I can find the network roadmap as well as it’s current state of development etc.?",
What's the advantage of staking in pre service but not for tbtc?? at the end of day we will be receiving rewards in T. Does those staking rewards vary for each service?,"each service may have different rewards, slashing conditions, and node requirements. so if you want max rewards, you probably run every service"
I voted for the tETH pool on Curve - but did not get any rewards? did the rewards get rugged?,"You need to claim the incentive. Pls check how votium or bribe.crv.finance work. The rewards are there, you need to claim them"
"Curious of T PRE, If a dApp utilizes T PRE, is there an eth(gas) fee associated with each transfer of encrypted data? Just thinking about the broader implication of eth/gas fees associated with utilization of T PRE and whether it could be a factor in hindering adoption of the tech","with granting and revoking, yes. but not per access 
but it's not feasible to run on eth l1
for threshold, the PolicyManager contract will be deployed on various L2s, starting with Matic"
Can an existing Ankr node be used for Threshold staking? ,"They’ll need to upgrade their nodes, but assuming they do that, yes"
What is CP?,Coverage Pool
When will coverage pool (CP) rewards go to for Keep? ,Still going until May in KEEP as planned unless there is a community proposal that changes it
How can I see the my balance of T tokens in Metamask?,You can add T to your metamask tokens by adding the T contract address to metamask. I think there's a place on the UI to add it as well.
And did the inflation of nu and keep stop?,"Inflation has been stopped on both networks. Keep had a different inflation structure in the sense that for Keep the total amount of tokens of 1B was minted at once, with different lock-ups and allocations. There were no new tokens minted after that. The total amount of Keep tokens that will ever be distributed  is fixed: 940,795,010 tokens. There is a remainer of 59,053,770 Keep tokens that exists but won't be distributed. 
You can read more details on this here. https://forum.keep.network/t/proposal-pause-keep-inflation-to-calculate-token-factor-for-threshold/375
There's coverage pools, liquidity pools, staked tokens, tokens that are locked in the vending machine etc. Whatever you consider circulating will obviously have a big impact on the number"
I want to ask how many T tokens are in circulation,"What Kudo said, the original minted supply is 10B. How much of that will go into circulation will depend on
1) the qty that NU holders will / can wrap to T
2) the qty that KEEP holders will / can wrap to T
3) the amount of T that the treasury spends from the Treasury

If you want to know how much T 'can' be wrapped you'd need to look into the supply curves of NU and KEEP

Then there'll be staking of T. Depends if you see this as circulating yes / no.

Below you can see the holders of the T tokens. The %'s here are the % of the T tokens.

I don’t know if this is the right place to ask but can anyone point me towards a guide for swapping NU to T? Thank you,Wrapping tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJOnWai4UzE
any notes on how a staking adapter works? ,"There will be staking adapters that allow existing NU and KEEP stakes to stake in Threshold as if they were staking the equivalent amount of T. For those with liquid NU or KEEP, the vending machine smart contract can be used to wrap those tokens to upgrade to T."
"Guys so quick question, in order to get the T token can you only get it by wrapping either Nu or Keep into T?","Threshold network is the protocol being built by Keep and Nucypher teams. According to the current time-line, if everything goes as expected, the merger contract which will allow to upgrade KEEP and NU tokens to T tokens will be deployed in December."
"Like as a staker, when can i wrap to T via adapters?","There is still KEEP and NU that is locked / unvested. The tokens can not be transferred, hence can also not be wrapped. The team explained there will be adapters for these cases that do allow to stake on the Threshold network (adapter will convert KEEP or NU stake to stakeweight in T using the token factor)"
do we have officially token factor for Nu and Keep to T ?,The token factor for NU will be 3 point something. The exact token factor will be determined once the network inflation is suspended. NU Token Factor = 4.5B / Token. Each NU and KEEP tokens can be wrapped to T. The amount of T received is the amount of NU * the token factor
"Do we have an approx date when T will be launched?? Like as a staker, when can i wrap to T via adapters???",This is the latest timeline. https://medium.com/@keep_project/a-provisional-timeline-for-the-threshold-merger-7593d5cb3771

you have the option of wrapping your NU into T and then you have T tokens instead of NU.... i'd imagine if you do this... and the networks gets traction... eventually everyone will wrap and move over"
do we have officially token factor for Nu and Keep to T ?,"hey, please check this message: https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/866378471868727319/913537726614220891"
so this means that 1 KEEP is going to be worth more T than 1 NU?,Yes. 4.5/3.33 = 1.35. You'll probably get 35% more T for your KEEP.
Is it possible to convert KEEP -> T -> NU ?,"No, only back to the original wrapped token"
"I was wondering where I can get information regarding what will happen once the merge goes through and what I will need to do, as both a token holder and a staker","For Keep stakers there is a merge FAQ document here - 

https://coda.io/@keep-network/merge-faq-stakers

All liquid KEEP is eligible to upgrade into T via a wrapping process. This will happen directly on the Keep Token Dashboard. When the time comes we will have detailed guides and be here to help with the process."
what's the cheapest way to get some $KEEP? ,"Not sure if this is the answer you are looking for but you can join a community guild, make quality contributions and earn KEEP that way"
what would happen to my NU coin if it is just in my Binance wallet?,"We don't have any information if Binance will support the T token transition, talking about exchanges, this will be up to them: They could facilitate the way for upgrading the tokens to T or it could be that you will need to follow the wrapping process everyone else follows, by doing it outside the exchange."
"Question: Once the merger is complete, will NU and KEEP exist as tokens projects to invest in on their own?",Yes KEEP and NU will continue to exist. The merge process is opt-in which means no one has to upgrade to Threshold if they do not want to.
Will the T coin be listed on binance?,https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/96698a6a80f64cb1ae27f813032bfaa9
"I have Threshold in my possession, what should I do if I want to vote ?",Click on the links on the announcement channel and it will ask to connect your web 3 wallet to vote. You have to make sure you had your T there before the snapshots were put up to vote
"Hello, can Nu and keep be downgraded back after upgrading to T?",If you use the vending machine using a web 3 wallet you will be able to but if the exchange does the distribution you won’t be able unwrap your T to your original token. It’s incentivize that people move over to T so Long term I don’t see why people will not wrap into T
how will wrapping help? more pools/farming oppurtunities?,"yes. you can earn yield only thru T, not thru nu/keep. Nu has direct applications to a few industries (healthcare being one, and HC spending in the US was ~$4trn in 2021, ~16% of total US GDP) so it's a fairly large end market that you could see stay on web 2 and use or move onto 3 and partner wtih. it's a unique KMS (key management system) where granting/permissioning sensitive private data can be done safely (think genetic, healthcare, private sensitive data). Keep - tbtc v2 is interesting bc it lets BTC owners operate within the ETH ecosystem without them having to give up/sell their  BTC. ~1.5% of BTC is on ETH last time i checked, and given institutional money's preference for crypto now (mainly BTC). There's a clear use case for it. main competition out there are wbtc, renbtc."
What do I have to do with my NU/KEEP tokens to get T?,"Nothing at the moment. Once we get closer to the launch of T, the team will post how to wrap your tokens for T by sending to a smart contract. "
What will happen if I hold my tokens on an exchange?,It will be up to the exchanges if they decide to support the merge.
Who do I have to talk to for listings?,"T will be an ERC20 token, so exchanges are able to list freely without involvement from the team. "
Who do I have to talk to for partnerships?,For integrations with our networks please reach out to the team on discord. https://discord.gg/W6YDG78B
Why doesn’t the team market? ,At the moment the team is busy sponsoring hackathons and growing the development side of the business.  All of the current marketing is community driven and anyone can get involved on discord. https://discord.gg/W6YDG78B
Is tBTC the same as T?,"No, T is the work token of the Threshold Network and tBTC is a fully Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin. It facilitates Bitcoin holders to act on the Ethereum blockchain and access the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem."
Will my NU/KEEP tokens not exist after the merge?,The token upgrade is completely optional and was designed with a no token left behind design that allows for the exchange/upgrade to be done whenever a user decides in the same manner and at the same exchange rate as you would receive on day one.
So wrapping will be available on metamask?,Not on metamask directly but you can use a web3 wallet to interface into our token dashboards to complete the wrapping process
Where are the token dashboards(sorry if this is a stupid question),For Keep it is here - https://dashboard.keep.network/overview. There will be a new section to support wrapping into T
"Does T inherit all of the cryptography properties of NU, or are any of the security protocols from Keep combined?","All of the previous services from NuCypher and Keep will run on T. That means PRE, tBTC v2 and the random beacon are all moving over to Threshold but will continue to live as separate applications on the upgraded network"
