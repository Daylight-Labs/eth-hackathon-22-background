{"text": "Hi!! Is it possible to buy Threshold Token via Uniswap v3 as this page says https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/threshold/"}
{"text": "Here is a great step-by-step guide  - https://youtu.be/ySFk0olAJpM"}
{"text": "If you buy Keep then you own keep until you choose to upgrade it to T.   If you hold that Keep on a CEX then you will be subject to their terms, whatever those might be."}

{"text": "The core of Threshold is a modular staking contract that supports different types of threshold cryptography applications"}
{"text": "Here you go: https://github.com/threshold-network/solidity-contracts/blob/main/docs/rfc-1-staking-contract.adoc"}
{"text": "So i've read up on Keeps and NuCypher individually. Does anyone have a good resource that explains how Threshold works? The blog posts are very vague and generalized, I'm looking for a whitepaper or the appropriate equivalent that explains how the Threshold protocol itself works."}
{"text": "Would put some Keep down on the superbowl but HODL that boyyyy"}

{"text": "I had to add T to my Trezor"}
{"text": "Yeah, you control the private key. Every erc20 token transaction can be tracked on Etherscan. My ledger doesn't show my T balance but the correct balance is reflected for my Ledger wallet address on Etherscan.\nThe T token simply hasn't been added to the ledger live app."}
{"text": "Ok thanks Maclane. Not into crypto too long so I am unsure with a lot of it."}
{"text": "Probably they have bad UI support for smart contract interactions"}
{"text": "How trezor decides to display that in their ui idk"}
{"text": "There is of course an on-chain transfer of the tokens"}

{"text": "Is there any reason why I don‚Äôt have a received transaction on my wallet and only a sent transaction"}
{"text": "in terms of the merger, is the goal to eventually get rid of all KEEP and Nu tokens?"}
{"text": "Depends on the gas price at the time you do the tx"}
{"text": "I see, so its only one Eth spend transaction. And that it‚Äôs in my wallet it‚Äôs wrapped I have nothing else to do. I was just curious as the thransaction fee was quiet low only 18 Dollars. And I have read here that some are paying over 50 Dollars"}
{"text": "You need to (1) approve the vending machine smart contract to spend your KEEP and (2) wrap the KEEP.\n\nThe UI combined those into a single ‚Äúapprove and call‚Äù tx"}
{"text": "One more question. Is it just one Eth transaction to wrap keep. I thought I read somewhere That it costs two Eth transactions to wrap. One to wrap and one to send to wallet"}
{"text": "I will check out that. Does that mean that I still control the private keys.  Was just wondering when it says I sent keep but no transaction for receiving T"}
{"text": "Same with ledger.\nLook at your wallet on Etherscan"}
{"text": "Yes"}
{"text": "Is that a reply to me"}
{"text": "Sounds like you‚Äôre good then"}
